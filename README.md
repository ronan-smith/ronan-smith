### Hi there, I'm Ronan...

As part of my job I **build and design websites** with WordPress, writing custom `CSS` and `PHP` frequently. In my spare time I build **websites** from scratch using `HTML5`, `CSS3` and `JavaScript (Vanilla)` - I occasionally use `PHP` for templating and write WordPress plugins.

I've also used `C# (Unity)` to design and develop **video game** systems. I've built a few **desktop apps** in `C# (WPF & WinForms)`, and used `Java (Swing)` and `VB.Net (WinForms)` sparingly too.

I enjoy **hiking** and occasional **photography**. My favorite **video games** are `Skyrim`, `Rimworld` and `Fallout 4`. My favorite **music artists** are `Five Finger Death Punch`, `Rise Against`, `Disturbed` and `Metalica`.
